4D Tic-Tac-Toe - An MGL Test App. by Marty Amodeo
=================================================
Version 1.1 - 4/4/2000

This is a simple application I threw together using Scitech's excellent
MGL (Multiplatform Graphics Library).  Though it is not terribly graphically
impressive, it exercises the ability of MGL to change to 640x480 8 bit color
screen mode and display graphics and directly access the hardware color
palette.  So far, most reports have been good, so I'm releasing the source
code in this package.

This version was built entirely using EMX, which was no small task.  As 
such, it may have some special kinks to work out, so I'm re-releasing this
demo to see if any EMX-specific quirks show up.  After this, on to
Retrocade and then MAME.  Also, if I determine my EMX-built libraries are
functioning well, I will distribute my ready-compiled MGL libraries, given
Scitech's permission to do so.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
You *must* install and boot up with a copy of SDDHELP.SYS from Scitech's
Display Doctor software from beta 19 or higher.  You must do this NO MATTER
WHICH VIDEO DRIVERS YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING.

This version also requires that the EMX runtime libraries are installed
on your system.  Download EMX .9d runtime (EMXRT.ZIP) from Hobbes or your
favorite OS/2 software archive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
If the Scitech Display Doctor video drivers work with your video hardware,
USE THEM.  :-)

CHANGES THIS VERSION:
---------------------
* BUILT USING EMX .9D
* SOURCE CODE RELEASED
* REMOVED ALL OS/2 PLATFORM DEPENDENCIES - this same source file should
  build under other MGL-supported environments (such as Linux, DOS, and
  <gag> Windoze) without touching a single line of code!
* Fixed a bug in scoring.  This also fixed a bug in the AI which relied
  on the scoring working properly.
* Made the fade-in/fade-out sequences a bit faster
* Fixed the initial "flash" of a block to the wrong color during a fade-in

NOTES:
------
If you use your vendor-provided video drivers, you will not be able to
take advantage of Scitech's Nucleus architecture and will not be able to
take advantage of many features of MGL, but will still be able to change
screen modes and have direct access to hardware, improving performance over
sticking to your desktop screen resolution and color depth.

Note that although you can switch out of the full screen graphics mode
using ALT-ESC, it is not recommended, as the application will remain
running, assuming it has full control of your display hardware.  I am
working on a way to fix this.  If you do happen to pop back to your PM
desktop while it is running, do not go back to the full screen session.
Bring up the window list and kill off the session.  Then go into and out
of a different full screen session to redraw the desktop properly.

MATROX OWNERS BEWARE!  I've tried MGL apps with the latest Matrox vendor
drivers for my Millenium 2 and they have resulted in locking up my system.
Be warned.  If you can use Scitech Display Doctor as your video drivers,
the lockups do not occur.

I have included the version of SDDHELP.SYS that I used to test this
program.  If you have your own version of SDDHELP.SYS installed on your
system already, then try using yours first and replace it only if this
program does not function with your version.  If you are using the
Scitech Display Doctor video drivers themselves, you should not replace
SDDHELP.SYS.  If your version is too old and this program does not
function, then update SDD itself on your system which will update
SDDHELP.SYS automatically.

If you get an error message on startup that says "No error", try the 
following (this is taken from a UseNet posting from Scitech's news
server in scitech.mgl.developer written by "Chris van der [Togt"
<c.vandertogt@amc.uva.nl>):

> Make sure you have a "config" directory in your drivers directory.
> Change graphics.vbe to graphics.bpd.  See if this helps.

RULES OF THE GAME:
------------------
Play Tic-Tac-Toe!  Just like the way it was when you were a kid, only a tie
is MUCH less likely.  ;-)

You may score by getting 3 in a row *in any dimension*.  Of course, the
standard X, Y, and Z coordinates apply to horizontal, vertical, and depth.
In addition, I've added a 4th dimension:  "time".  The column of boards on
the left represents the "past", the center column is the "present", and the
right column is the "future".  Being an immortal god of Tic-Tac-Toe, you may
move freely throughout these boards and place moves in whichever time-frame
you like.  If you get three in a straight row in any dimension, or diagonal
in any dimension, or straight in one dimension and diagonal in another, or
... the possibilities are many to score.

Try if you can to defeat AI I have programmed, or sit back and watch the AI
play itself to learn some strategies.  I've made it fairly strong, taking 
into account offensive and defensive moves.  It also takes into account
potential ability to score and immediate ability to score.  If you do manage
to beat it, drop me a line and let me know how close it was.  ;-)

SOURCE CODE:
------------
The source code for this application is provided and should always be
provided with any distribution of the binary.  When I determine that the
MGL library files I've used to build the binary are fully functional, I
will distribute them also (when I confirm that I have Scitech's permission
to do so).  At that point, you should be able to unzip the archive and
build your own version, but as of now, you'll have to build the MGL
libraries yourself and my makefile will be non-functional.

FEEDBACK:
---------
Write to mamedev@stny.rr.com and give me a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down"
along with describing your video drivers and video hardware setup.

either by FTP or through the web, or it may be distributed on a CD with
